# Database-Assignment
This is my database assignment from my diploma of IT
The assignment involved creating a mock business with a front end store, and a backend warehouse. We had to design the database tables and relationships
around the needs of a client (the teacher), and create the database in SQL management studio using SQL injections. 

It showcases SQL injections, edits and queries. As well as an understanding of the underlying principles of database design and management.
